# AI Agent Rules and Guidelines

This directory contains centralized rules and guidelines for all AI agents working on this repository.

## Directory Structure

- `/rules/` - Core rules that all AI agents must follow
  - `integrity-and-test-ethics.md` - Core ethical principles
  - `simplicity.md` - Guidelines for keeping solutions simple
  - `architecture.md` - Technical architecture principles
  - `continuous-learning.md` - Learning from retrospectives and RFCs
  - `successful-debugging-patterns.md` - Debug issues systematically

## Purpose

These rules are designed to ensure consistency, quality, and ethical behavior across all AI agents. They have been tested and proven in real project environments and should be followed without exception.

## How to Use

AI agents should:
1. Read and understand all rules before starting work
2. Reference specific rules when making decisions
3. Cite the relevant rule when explaining a decision
4. Follow the rules even when not explicitly instructed to do so

## Rule Precedence

In case of conflicting guidance, rules take precedence in the following order:
1. `integrity-and-test-ethics.md` (highest priority)
2. Project-specific requirements
3. Other rules in this directory
4. General best practices

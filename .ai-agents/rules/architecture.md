# Architecture

Maintain clean architectural boundaries by using appropriate technologies for each task.

## Core Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep different parts of the system focused on their specific responsibilities.
2. **Clean Interfaces**: Define clear interfaces between components.
3. **Appropriate Technologies**: Use the right tool for each job.
4. **Testability**: Design components to be easily testable.
5. **Scalability**: Consider how the architecture will scale with increased load or complexity.

## Guidelines

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Model the system around the business domain
- **Layered Architecture**: Maintain clear separation between layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Use dependency injection for flexible component composition
- **Interface-First Design**: Define interfaces before implementations
- **Consistent Patterns**: Apply consistent patterns throughout the codebase

## Technology Selection

- Use natural language processing technologies for language understanding tasks
- Use deterministic code for business logic and data processing
- Select appropriate data storage technologies based on access patterns
- Choose UI frameworks based on application requirements and team expertise

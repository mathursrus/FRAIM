# Clean Architecture Guidelines

## INTENT
To maintain clean architectural boundaries by separating concerns between AI/LLM components for natural-language understanding and deterministic code for side-effectful and rule-based work, ensuring optimal performance and maintainability.

## PRINCIPLES
- **Separation of Concerns**: AI for semantic operations, deterministic code for business logic
- **Performance Optimization**: Use appropriate tools for each type of operation
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between different system components
- **Testability**: Deterministic components are easily testable

## ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARIES

### AI/LLM Layer (Semantic Operations)
**Purpose**: Natural language understanding, content generation, semantic analysis

**Use Cases**:
- Text classification and sentiment analysis
- Content generation and summarization
- Natural language query processing
- Semantic search and matching
- Intent recognition and extraction

**Examples**:
```typescript
// Good: Use AI for semantic operations
const intent = await classifyUserIntent(userMessage);
const summary = await generateSummary(longText);
const sentiment = await analyzeSentiment(feedback);
```

### Deterministic Layer (Business Logic)
**Purpose**: Interface driven integrations, Rule-based operations, Data processing

**Use Cases**:
- Database operations and data persistence
- API integrations and external service calls
- Business rule enforcement
- Data validation and transformation
- System orchestration and workflow management

**Examples**:
```typescript
// Good: Use deterministic code for business logic
const user = await userService.findById(userId);
const isValid = validateInputFormat(input);
const result = await paymentService.processPayment(amount);
```

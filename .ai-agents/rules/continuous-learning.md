# Continuous Learning

Prevent repeating past mistakes by systematically learning from retrospectives, RFCs, and historical issue patterns.

## Core Principles

1. **Learn from History**: Review past issues and solutions before starting similar work.
2. **Document Learnings**: Capture insights in retrospectives and knowledge bases.
3. **Share Knowledge**: Ensure learnings are accessible to all team members.
4. **Evolve Practices**: Continuously refine processes based on experience.
5. **Anticipate Issues**: Use historical patterns to predict and prevent problems.

## Guidelines

- **Review Retrospectives**: Always review relevant retrospectives before starting work
- **RFC Analysis**: Study RFCs for design decisions and rationales
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring issues and their root causes
- **Knowledge Base**: Contribute to and utilize the team's knowledge base
- **Feedback Loops**: Create tight feedback loops for rapid learning

## Implementation

- Before starting work on an issue, search for similar past issues
- Review retrospectives from related features or components
- Check knowledge base for relevant patterns and anti-patterns
- Document new learnings after completing work
- Share insights with the team through appropriate channels

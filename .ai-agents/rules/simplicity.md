# Simplicity

Keep solutions simple and focused, avoid over-engineering.

## Core Principles

1. **Focus on the Current Issue**: When fixing an issue, focus only on that issue.
2. **Avoid Premature Optimization**: Don't optimize code until there's a demonstrated need.
3. **Minimize Dependencies**: Add new dependencies only when absolutely necessary.
4. **Readable Over Clever**: Prefer readable code over clever solutions.
5. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, focused changes rather than large rewrites.

## Guidelines

- **Single Responsibility**: Each function, class, or module should have a single responsibility
- **Explicit Over Implicit**: Favor explicit code over implicit behavior
- **Standard Patterns**: Use standard patterns and idioms when possible
- **Minimal API Surface**: Keep public APIs minimal and focused
- **Avoid Premature Abstraction**: Don't abstract until you see repeated patterns

## When Fixing Issues

- Focus only on the specific issue at hand
- Avoid making unrelated changes
- File separate issues for other problems you discover
- Keep the scope narrow and well-defined

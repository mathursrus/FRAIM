# Successful Debugging Patterns

Debug issues systematically and convert learnings into test cases.

## Core Principles

1. **Systematic Approach**: Follow a structured debugging methodology.
2. **Evidence-Based**: Base conclusions on evidence, not assumptions.
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause, not just symptoms.
4. **Test Case Creation**: Create tests that verify the fix and prevent regression.
5. **Knowledge Sharing**: Document findings for future reference.

## Debugging Methodology

1. **Reproduce**: Create a reliable reproduction of the issue
2. **Isolate**: Narrow down the scope to the smallest possible area
3. **Hypothesize**: Form testable hypotheses about the cause
4. **Test**: Verify or disprove each hypothesis systematically
5. **Fix**: Address the root cause, not just symptoms
6. **Verify**: Confirm the fix resolves the issue
7. **Prevent**: Add tests to prevent regression

## Best Practices

- Use logging strategically to gather information
- Leverage debugging tools appropriate for the technology
- Break complex issues into smaller, testable components
- Document the debugging process and findings
- Create regression tests that would have caught the issue

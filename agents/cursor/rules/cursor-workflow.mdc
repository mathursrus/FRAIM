# Cursor Development Workflow

## Goal
Work efficiently in local environment while maintaining coordination with remote repository and other agents.

## Behavior
- Use local file system for development work
- ***NEVER*** commit unless asked to do so
- Produce clear progress updates with:
  1. Actions executed (imperative, past tense)
  2. Local progress (files modified, tests run)
  3. Remote artifacts (branch, PR status)
  4. Next steps for this issue
  5. Blocking issues (if any)

## Stop Criteria
- When the assigned work is complete
- When tests pass and PR is ready for review
- When waiting for reviewer feedback

## Output Template
- Summary:
  - Local progress: [what you accomplished locally]
  - Remote status: [branch/PR status]

Step 1: Ask for {issue_number}

Step 2: Clone the repo to "<repo> - Issue {issue_number}" 
- **CRITICAL**: Clone ONE LEVEL ABOVE the current workspace directory
- **DO NOT** clone inside the current workspace folder
- **VERIFY LOCATION**: Use `pwd` to confirm you're in the parent directory before cloning

Step 3: Confirm items in the checklist and say "Huzzah!"


## Safety Checklist
- [ ] Confirmed current workspace path with `pwd`
- [ ] Changed to parent directory (`cd ..`) before cloning
- [ ] Verified clone location is outside current workspace
- [ ] Successfully changed into cloned repository

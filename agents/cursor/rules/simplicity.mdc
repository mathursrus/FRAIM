****Keep it simple. Don't over-engineer. *****
Don't over-think it. 
While fixing an issue, focus on that issue only. Don't fix other issues. Don't make unrelated changes. Instead, file a Git issue if you find other issues that aren't already tracked by an existing Git issue.


Always verify the action you have taken. Do not expect the user to verify it for you. 
If you kicked off a Git workflow, verify it completed successfully (e.g., gh checks: list or PR status).
If you wrote a test and expect it to pass, run it yourself and verify it passes; if you expect it to fail, verify it fails.
Always link work to the issue (use “Closes #<n>” in the Implementation PR).
Open Draft PRs early; review happens in the PR, not in chat.

Agents must not run gh pr create. Push to the feature branch and let Actions open Draft PRs.

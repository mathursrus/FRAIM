# Issue Resolution Process

Always work on the feature branch for the current issue: `feature/<issue#>-<kebab-title>`. Never push to master.

## Development Workflow
1. **Clone Setup**: Work in your own cloned repository folder.
2. **Branch Management**: Create/checkout feature branch for your issue
3. **Local Development**: Make changes, run tests locally
4. **Check before commit**: Only commit after approval from the user.
5. **Remote Coordination**: Use GitHub MCP for issue labels

## Phases
- **Design**: Set ISSUE to `phase:design` → create RFC
- **Implementation**: Set ISSUE to `phase:impl` → implement solution

## Status Management
- **WIP**: Automatically set when entering new phase
- **Needs Review**: Set this when work is ready for review
- **Complete**: Automatically set when PR is approved

## PR Requirements
- Implementation PR body MUST include `Closes #<n>`
- Let Actions handle PR creation and updates
- Address all reviewer feedback before completion

## Cleanup
When user confirms code is correctly merged into master, confirm with the user, then 
- delete remote branch
- delete local branch
- remove your local clone folder:
```
cd ..
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "<repo> - Issue {issue_number}"
```

Respect CODEOWNERS; don't modify auth/CI without approval.

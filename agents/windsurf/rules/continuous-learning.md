# Continuous Learning

## Retrospectives Review
- **Always review** the `/retrospectives/` folder before starting work on similar issues
- **Learn from past problems** - understand root cause analysis and lessons learned
- **Apply previous solutions** - don't repeat mistakes that have already been solved

## Knowledge Integration
- **Read related RFCs** in `/docs/rfcs/` to understand design decisions
- **Review test cases** to see how similar problems were approached
- **Check issue history** for patterns in failures and solutions

## Local Development Benefits
- **Avoid known pitfalls** by learning from retrospectives
- **Build on existing solutions** rather than starting from scratch
- **Understand system constraints** from past architectural decisions

## Before Starting Work
1. **Search retrospectives** for related issues or similar problems
2. **Read relevant RFCs** to understand the design context
3. **Review test cases** to see expected behavior
4. **Check issue comments** for previous attempts and solutions

## Document Your Learning
- **Update retrospectives** if you discover new insights
- **Add to RFCs** if you find better approaches
- **Share solutions** with other agents through issue comments

## Retrospective Triggers

### **Automatic Retrospective Requirements**
- **Complex Issues (>3 iterations)**: Must create retrospective before issue closure
- **Process Violations**: Any workflow rule violations require retrospectives
- **Work Loss Incidents**: Any incidents where work is lost require detailed retrospectives

### **Retrospective Creation Process**
1. **Stop Current Work**: Pause issue resolution if retrospective is required
2. **Create Retrospective**: Use standard template in retrospectives folder
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify underlying causes, not just symptoms
4. **Prevention Measures**: Document specific actions to prevent recurrence
5. **Process Updates**: Update rules and workflows based on learnings

Remember: The best code is often written by those who learn from history rather than repeat it.

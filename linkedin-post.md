# FRAIMv2 - The Future of how we work with AI?

ðŸš€ **AI coding agents are brilliant but chaotic.**

They can build prototypes fast, but fail spectacularly at production-ready code.

**Solution: Manage them like human developers.**

FRAIMv2 applies enterprise-grade discipline to AI agent teams:
â€¢ Clear guardrails to prevent costly mistakes
â€¢ Structured workflows to avoid chaos
â€¢ Evidence-based validation (not "looks good" claims)
â€¢ Learning systems to improve over time
â€¢ Debugging patterns and anti-patterns
â€¢ Balance between determinism and creativity

**Result:** Transform from solo developer to AI manager orchestrating production-ready code.

Is this the future of how we work?

# Continuous Learning

## Core Principle
Prevent repeating past mistakes by systematically learning from retrospectives, RFCs, and historical issue patterns.

## Key Guidelines

### Before Starting Work
- **Review Retrospectives**: Always review relevant retrospectives before starting similar work
- **Study RFCs**: Read related RFCs to understand design decisions and rationale
- **Examine Past Issues**: Look for similar issues that have been solved previously
- **Check Knowledge Base**: Review documentation and knowledge base articles

### During Development
- **Document Decisions**: Record important decisions and their rationale
- **Capture Learnings**: Note insights and learnings as they occur
- **Share Knowledge**: Share discoveries with the team in real-time
- **Update Documentation**: Improve documentation as you learn

### After Completion
- **Conduct Retrospectives**: Always conduct a retrospective after completing significant work
- **Update Knowledge Base**: Add new learnings to the knowledge base
- **Improve Processes**: Suggest improvements to processes based on experience
- **Refine Templates**: Update templates with new best practices

## Learning Sources

### Retrospectives
- Review retrospectives for similar features or issues
- Look for patterns across multiple retrospectives
- Focus on both successes and failures
- Extract actionable insights

### RFCs and Design Documents
- Understand the reasoning behind design decisions
- Note which approaches worked and which didn't
- Learn from architectural evolution
- Apply successful patterns to new work

### Issue History
- Study how similar issues were resolved
- Identify recurring problems and their solutions
- Learn from bug patterns and their fixes
- Understand user feedback patterns

### Team Knowledge
- Leverage collective experience
- Consult with team members who worked on similar issues
- Share insights across teams
- Build on others' learnings

## Implementation Practices

### Knowledge Capture
- Use standardized templates for retrospectives
- Document decisions in a consistent format
- Create searchable knowledge base entries
- Link related issues and documents

### Knowledge Sharing
- Make retrospectives accessible to all team members
- Present key learnings in team meetings
- Create learning summaries for complex issues
- Mentor others based on your experience

### Knowledge Application
- Apply learnings to new work
- Reference past experiences in design discussions
- Use historical data to inform estimates
- Validate new approaches against past outcomes

## Measuring Success
- Reduction in recurring issues
- Faster resolution of similar problems
- Improved quality metrics over time
- Increased team knowledge sharing

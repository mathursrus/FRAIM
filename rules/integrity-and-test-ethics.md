# Integrity and Test Ethics

**THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL RULE**

## Core Principles

1. **Truth Above All**: Always be truthful about test results, capabilities, and limitations.
2. **No Fabrication**: Never fabricate test results or claim tests have passed when they haven't been run.
3. **Complete Evidence**: Provide complete evidence for all test claims, including:
   - Actual command output
   - Screenshots where appropriate
   - Specific test case IDs that passed/failed
   - Timestamps of test runs

## Test Ethics Requirements

### Before Testing
- Clearly document test objectives
- Define success criteria before running tests
- Prepare test environments properly
- Document test assumptions

### During Testing
- Run complete test suites, not just "happy paths"
- Document all unexpected behaviors
- Capture all relevant logs and outputs
- Never skip tests without explicit justification

### After Testing
- Report all results honestly, including failures
- Document any workarounds or limitations
- Provide clear reproduction steps for issues
- Never downplay or hide negative results

## Ethical AI Development

- Be transparent about AI capabilities and limitations
- Acknowledge when you don't know something
- Clearly distinguish between facts and opinions/predictions
- Recognize and mitigate potential biases

## Accountability

- Take responsibility for your recommendations
- Acknowledge mistakes promptly
- Learn from failures and document lessons
- Prioritize long-term correctness over short-term convenience

## Evidence Standards

All claims must be backed by one or more of:
1. Direct test output
2. Verifiable metrics
3. Documented observations
4. Reproducible steps

Remember: Integrity is non-negotiable. It's better to acknowledge limitations than to make false claims.

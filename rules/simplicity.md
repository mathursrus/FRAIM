# Simplicity

## Core Principle
Keep solutions simple, focused, and avoid over-engineering. Simplicity is a feature, not a bug.

## Key Guidelines

### Focus on the Current Issue
- Work on one issue at a time
- Don't fix unrelated issues while working on the current one
- If you find other issues, file them separately rather than fixing them inline
- Stay within the scope defined by the issue description

### Avoid Over-Engineering
- Start with the simplest solution that meets requirements
- Add complexity only when justified by clear requirements
- Prefer readable code over clever code
- Use existing libraries and patterns when appropriate

### Code Simplicity
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Minimize dependencies between components
- Avoid premature optimization
- Prefer explicit over implicit

### Design Simplicity
- Choose the simplest architecture that meets requirements
- Avoid speculative design for future requirements
- Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces
- Document design decisions and rationale

### Process Simplicity
- Use straightforward workflows
- Minimize process overhead
- Document only what's necessary
- Automate repetitive tasks

## When Complexity is Justified
- Performance requirements that can't be met with simpler solutions
- Security requirements that necessitate additional layers
- Compliance requirements that mandate specific approaches
- Proven scalability needs based on concrete metrics

## How to Maintain Simplicity
- Regularly refactor to reduce complexity
- Review code for unnecessary complexity
- Question additions that increase complexity
- Measure the impact of complexity on maintenance costs

Remember: Every line of code is a liability. The best code is the code you don't have to write.

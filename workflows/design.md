# Design Phase Workflow

## Overview
The design phase focuses on understanding requirements, exploring solutions, and creating a detailed plan before implementation begins.

## Prerequisites
- Issue with `status:ready-for-design` label
- All required context and requirements documented

## Steps

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Review the issue description thoroughly
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements
- Clarify any ambiguous requirements with stakeholders
- Document constraints and assumptions

### 2. Solution Exploration
- Brainstorm potential approaches
- Research existing solutions and patterns
- Evaluate trade-offs between different approaches
- Consider performance, maintainability, and scalability

### 3. Architecture Design
- Define the high-level architecture
- Identify key components and their interactions
- Document API contracts between components
- Consider error handling and edge cases

### 4. Technical Specification
- Create a detailed technical specification
- Include data models and schemas
- Define algorithms and business logic
- Document integration points with external systems

### 5. Implementation Plan
- Break down the work into manageable tasks
- Estimate effort for each task
- Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Define acceptance criteria for each task

### 6. Review and Approval
- Submit the design for review
- Address feedback from reviewers
- Get final approval from stakeholders
- Update the issue with design decisions

## Deliverables
- RFC document in `/docs/rfcs/`
- Technical specification
- Implementation plan
- Updated issue with design decisions

## Transition to Implementation
- Add `status:ready-for-implementation` label to the issue
- Remove `status:in-design` label
- Create implementation tasks if needed

## Best Practices
- Focus on solving the specific problem at hand
- Avoid over-engineering
- Consider future extensibility without over-designing
- Document design decisions and their rationale
- Consider security, performance, and maintainability

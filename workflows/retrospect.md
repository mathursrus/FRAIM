# Retrospective Workflow

## Overview
The retrospective workflow focuses on learning from completed work, identifying what went well and what could be improved, and documenting lessons for future reference.

## Prerequisites
- Completed issue or project
- Resolved pull request
- Deployed changes (if applicable)

## Steps

### 1. Preparation
- Gather all relevant information about the issue/project
- Review the original requirements and objectives
- Collect metrics and data about the implementation
- Identify key stakeholders and contributors

### 2. Retrospective Meeting (if applicable)
- Schedule a meeting with all contributors
- Set an agenda focused on learning, not blame
- Create a safe environment for honest feedback
- Take notes on key points and action items

### 3. Document What Went Well
- Identify successful approaches and decisions
- Note effective collaboration patterns
- Highlight technical solutions that worked well
- Document processes that should be repeated

### 4. Document What Could Be Improved
- Identify challenges and obstacles encountered
- Note inefficiencies in the process
- Highlight technical decisions that caused problems
- Document areas where more support or resources were needed

### 5. Technical Decision Analysis
- For each major technical decision:
  - Document the context and constraints
  - List the options that were considered
  - Explain why a particular option was chosen
  - Describe the consequences of the decision
  - Note what was learned from the outcome

### 6. Action Items
- Create specific, actionable improvements
- Assign owners to each action item if appropriate
- Set timeframes for implementation
- Ensure action items are tracked in the issue system

### 7. Knowledge Sharing
- Create or update documentation based on learnings
- Share retrospective document with the team
- Present key findings in team meetings if appropriate
- Ensure lessons are accessible for future reference

## Deliverables
- Completed retrospective document using the template
- Updated documentation incorporating lessons learned
- Action items for process improvements
- Knowledge sharing artifacts

## Best Practices
- Focus on learning, not blame
- Be specific about what worked and what didn't
- Include both technical and process observations
- Create actionable improvements
- Document decisions and their context
- Make the retrospective accessible for future reference

# Testing Phase Workflow

## Overview
The testing phase focuses on verifying that the implementation meets all requirements and quality standards.

## Prerequisites
- Completed implementation
- Issue with `status:ready-for-testing` label
- Pull request created

## Steps

### 1. Test Planning
- Review the implementation and requirements
- Identify test scenarios and edge cases
- Define test acceptance criteria
- Create a test plan if not already done

### 2. Unit Testing
- Verify all unit tests are present and passing
- Ensure adequate code coverage
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Document any test gaps

### 3. Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Verify API contracts are honored
- Test data flows between components
- Identify any integration issues

### 4. End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user flows
- Verify business requirements are met
- Test in an environment similar to production
- Document any issues found

### 5. Performance Testing
- Measure response times
- Identify bottlenecks
- Test under load if applicable
- Verify performance meets requirements

### 6. Security Testing
- Review for security vulnerabilities
- Test authentication and authorization
- Verify data protection measures
- Document any security concerns

### 7. Documentation Review
- Verify documentation is accurate and complete
- Ensure API documentation is up to date
- Check that usage examples are correct
- Update documentation if needed

### 8. Evidence Collection
- Gather test results and metrics
- Document any issues found
- Create evidence report using the template
- Link evidence to the pull request

## Deliverables
- Completed test evidence document
- Updated documentation if needed
- Test results and metrics
- List of any issues found

## Transition to Done
- Add `status:tested` label to the issue
- Remove `status:in-testing` label
- Request final review if all tests pass
- Create issues for any bugs found

## Best Practices
- Follow the RIGOR methodology
- Document all test results, even failures
- Be thorough and methodical
- Provide clear evidence of testing
- Don't hesitate to reject implementations that don't meet quality standards
